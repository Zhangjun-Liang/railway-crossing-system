# railway-crossing-system
This project was created as a component of Assignment 1: The Engineering Method for the University of Canberra's Introduction to Computer Engineering course (8223/10096).  The project's objective is to create a logic-based railway level crossing safety system that lifts gates only when it is absolutely safe to do so and automatically lowers them when a train approaches or a car is spotted on the tracks.  The design process systematically adheres to the engineering technique, which includes problem analysis, alternative exploration, evaluation of potential solutions, implementation of the final design using a flowchart and plain-English algorithm, and testing of the solution in a range of scenarios.
The repository is arranged into folders that match the assignment's main steps.  The problem restatement, input and output identification, and stakeholder and constraint discussion are all included in the Step 1 folder.  Two different logic-based solutions are provided in the Step 2 folder, along with a reference real-world case study.  The examination of alternatives and the rationale for the selected design based on simplicity, safety, and dependability requirements are included in the Step 3 & 4 folder.  The implementation is explained using plain English word code and a corresponding flowchart made with Draw.io in the Step 5 & 6 folder.The Step 7 folder contains the results of the testing process, including test case tables that compare expected and actual outputs, as well as proposed refinements. Finally, the Reflection folder documents the use of an AI agent (Microsoft Copilot) to refine the logic, generate alternatives, and reflect on the role of AI in engineering problem solving.
The problem analysis, alternative design suggestions, a clear engineering choice, an implementation plan in plain English, a flowchart visualisation, and systematic testing and improvement are some of the project's main deliverables.  Additionally, the repository shows how to use GitHub as a professional project management platform.  Every step is explained, changes are marked with insightful comments, and supplementary files like the PNG flowchart and the PDF or markdown test case tables are provided.  The link to the repository guarantees that the lecturer and tutor can read the entire project submission, examine its organisation, and follow its progress.
In the course Introduction to Computer Engineering (8223/10096) at the University of Canberra, Student ID u3289423, wrote the project.  The purpose of all work is to show that the engineering technique is understood, that collaborative tools like GitHub are used effectively, and that artificial intelligence (AI) is included into contemporary engineering practice as a supporting tool.
