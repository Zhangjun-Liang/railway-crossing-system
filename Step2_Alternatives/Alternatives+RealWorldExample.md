When developing the railway crossing system, one should consider that various logic-based solutions could be suggested but the most appropriate one could be chosen as the result. The easiest solution and most basic, solution A, involves the installation of a simple train detection sensor that mechanically drops the gates whenever it detects a train and raises it auto mantically only after the train passes. The design is simple and less costly and can be ineffective in accommodating motor vehicles before the train signal is free thereby causing safety hazards. Solution B is a more sophisticated alternative, using a two-sensor method in that: the train detection system and a vehicle presence sensor would both have to be cleared before a gate could be opened. Here, the gates are kept down in case of a train being still coming or a car detected on rail tracks. This design is more complicated but would give greater safety since the gate will not open prematurely.
An instance in the real world is in Bangladesh, where a prototype was designed and tested where researchers used Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and reflective photoelectric sensors. Their system identified moving trains and the road objects automatically on the tracks, opened and closed gate barriers, warning light, alert signal by PLC logic. The authors indicated that such an automated design minimizes the risks of human error in the manual operation of gates, not only in the operation speed but also in improving the safety of road users as well.
