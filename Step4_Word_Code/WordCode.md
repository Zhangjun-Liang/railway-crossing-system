In the logic sequence, continuous monitoring of all the critical inputs as train detection, vehicle presence, emergency override, and the minimum hold timer is provided. Danger detection is the condition of the utmost importance. In the case of a train approaching, the system will automatically order the gates to be lowered as well as a vehicle present on the tracks. Concurrently, blinking lights and audible warning measures are engaged, to warn road users. Should the emergency button be activated, the system takes control, and the gates are commanded to stay down irrespective of other inputs, putting highest safety precautions first.
A holding phase of the system is reached after lowering the gates. In this state the gates will not open till three independent conditions will be met: (1) train has completely passed, (2) no car or other obstacles on the track, (3) a minimum hold timer expires. Only after all three has been met, the system goes to the next phase. When any of these fails the system restores the timer or keeps the gates down. This helps avoid the gates being lifted early and ensuring that indeed the crossing is safe then reopening it.
Upon completion of checks on the safety conditions that ensure that all are acceptable, the system transitions into the release phase. Warning lights and alarm are switched off; the gates are lifted in this stage. The system will proceed then to its idle monitoring state, waiting to repeat the process on responsive to any train event. The logic used in the process, however, provides safety-based options as the default option. There is a possibility that an input signal may be unclear or a sensor malfunction, in which case the gates will be kept lowered until the system has been assured that it is safe to raise the gates.
