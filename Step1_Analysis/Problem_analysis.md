The issue is how to develop a trustworthy safety system of the railway crossings, when the gates have automatic control, preventing trains collisions with vehicles. It should also be inculcated into the system such that gates should be lowered whenever a train is nearby or when a car still sits in the tracks but not lifted until the whole area is clear and safe.
The system has various inputs to accomplish this. These comprise a train detection sensor that detects when a train is close, a vehicle presence sensor that detects the presence of a vehicle or object left on the tracks, an emergency override button which lets human operators override atypical circumstances, and a timer so that even after a train has passed, the gates remain down a minimum amount of time. Depending on such inputs, the system can provide outputs like closing or opening of the gates, switching on of flashing lights and warning bells to warn road users, as well as sending status signals to the railway operators to monitor it optionally.
There are also major constraints that should be taken into consideration in the design. Technically the sensors should be reliable and fail-safe: in the event of uncertainties, the default system should be the safe system (gates down). In economic terms, it should be economical to roll out the system in numerous crossings. Socially it must save lives and not keep drivers waiting more than is necessary. Environmentally, the alarms and lights should not be so disturbing to the neighbouring residents. On a legal basis, the system should be able to meet the railway standards and those of the government. 
Lastly, this system affects a few stakeholders. It ensures smooth and safe train operations, depending on which railway operators use it. Pedestrians and drivers rely on it to guarantee their own safety in getting across. Its schedules of noise and operation affect the lives of the residents, and the government authorities take care of safety regulations and compliance. Such interaction or supersession of the system may also be required during emergencies by emergency services. Collectively, these inputs, outputs, constraints and stakeholders determine the scope and context of the engineering challenge.
